# XG8800 Arduino with WiFi / 3G / BLE &amp; LCD

Combine an XG8800 LCD module with your choice of CPU module to create a standalone wireless touchscreen  display. It's compatible with many CPU modules: MKR family - ESP32-DevKitC - Pycom family - Particle family - Adafruit Feather - plain old Arduino. The Arduino <a href="http://www.littlevgl.com" target="_blank"> LittleVGL </a>and/or XGLCD libraries make creating sketches very easy. Start designing products which allow monitoring and controlling remote hardware through WiFi, BLE, LoRa, GSM, SigFox, ... without hardware or software worries. Use the <a href="http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove_System/" target="_blank">Grove connectors</a> to add any kind of I/O interface without the need for soldering.

The XG8800 is available with a 9.0" or 5.0" 800x480 TFT LCD with touchscreen. The 9.0" high resolution LCD allows you to make stunning looking wireless Arduino tablet-size projects. The medium sized 5.0" LCD is perfect for your wireless Arduino project requiring a smartphone-sized LCD.

You can add up to 6 Grove expansion modules. There is also an SDCard socket to store all fonts and images required to build a nice looking graphic user interface for your projects.

The CPU module USB connector is used to power the module. Alternatively a power input Grove connector or a compact AC/DC plug-in module(100V to 240V) can also be used.

Do you prefer to use a standard Arduino CPU board, the XG8800 is also available with Arduino headers. And also check the <a href="www.codevision.be"> CodeVisionAVR</a> website for an Atmel AVR version.
